                            I had the pleasure recently of facilitating the “Chairman’s BD Bootcamp” and found myself with a slightly nervous collection of twenty handpicked partners at 8.30am – all wondering quite what the Chairman had in store for them and why he’d chosen the drill hall of an army reserve base as the venue for the event. There was an expectation that someone would shout “drop and give me twenty!” but they needn’t have worried. The Chairman explained that he had planned something fiendish like that but had found that it wasn’t allowed. Health and safety, eh?
                        </p>
